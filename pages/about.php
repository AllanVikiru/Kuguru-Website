                      KFCL (Kuguru Food Complex Limited) has had experience in the mass-market beverage manufacture and distribution since 1992; KFCL was founded in 1988. KFCL is one of the top manufactures of beverages in the Kenyan Republic. KFCL is a family business founded by the family patriarch, Mr. Peter Kuguru. He and his wife built up the company for five years before being joined by four new family members.
                      KFCL began manufacturing the product Chibuku, a South African Sorghum beer, originally operated by the multinational Lonrho in Kenya. The success of the alcoholic beverages did not stop KFCL from diversifying into mass-market products. KFCL expanded into maize meal starting with two mills followed by procuring plastic manufacturing machines that promoted quality through plastic packaged products.                       
                      In an effort to diversify, KFCL decided to leave alcoholic beverages and concentrate solely on soft drinks. The most promising projects are the soft drink bottling plant and ready to drink fruit juices. This sector of the beverage market offers unlimited possibilities to KFCL's already established beverage network. KFCL has ensured that it maintains policies that are visionary and intrepid to stay ahead of the ever-dynamic Kenyan economy.
